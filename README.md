# Unity Dialogue System
A system for easily scaled branching dialogue for roguelike games in Unity. Written in C#.

Messenger.cs script is not our design. Credit for the code can be found at

#Instructions
Dialogue json files should be placed under a "StreamingAssets" folder within the Unity project assets.
Alternatively, the file path found in "DictionaryCoverter.cs" can be adjusted accordingly.

A functional version of the dialogue system can be found under the "Unity Demonstration" folder of the repository.
